# Markdown-convertor
## I - what it is  ?
This is a program made on python3 who convert Markdown file to html file.  
I used three package [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/), [markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) and 
[regex](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/re.html).  
I create this program as part of a school project.  
  
## II - How to use it ?
The Markdown convertor must be used in a command prompt.  
First you have to open a command prompt and find the program in your file with the cd command if your on windows.
```
cd yourdirectory
```
secondly you have to execute him using python and easy commands.
```
python convert.py
```
## III - commands  
```
-i The path of the file you whant to convert.  
-o The path of the directory where you want to put the html file.
--help show you all the commands usable.
```
Another command don't work. The -a command should make your text understandable by german by transforming all s in z for example but it's not working so she's not available to use but you can see what i tried in my program.  
## IV - what you need to do?  
Write your Markdown the best as you can with the good syntax because the program try to convert all text but he isn't perfect so he got some problem I tried to correct without success.  
You need to have python 3.7 installed on your PC or install it [here](https://www.python.org/)  
You need to install two package in your command prompt :
```
pip install click
pip install markdown2
```
After that you know everything to use Markdown-convertor.  
If you want to try this project all you have to do is understand french.
